# Powershell-windows-notify
This is a repo is a small project where the idea is to create a function that trigger other functions to inform users about an event or issue.
Example: Server X goes down and that means that AD group X cannot access their data.
The function will be run by the IT department where they can give a titel and description and where it needs to be send to.
When ready the function will send a notification to Sharepoint intranet , Windows notification, teams, email, yammer, ...
The idea came from having to post on multiple places and by the time it is done, most of the time the issue is resolved as well.
So it has to be quick, easy and straith forward to use, from a end user perspective.
